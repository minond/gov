G.O.V. is a tool for managing Go versions.

To get started, simply download the `gov` executable and add it to your path,
then run `gov init`, which will set up the directory structure and display code
that should be added to your bashrc file.


Usage:

        gov <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

        help                show this help output
        init                initialize G.O.V.
        list                display a list of Go versions and their installation status
        download <version>  download a specific version
        link <version>      link a specific version
        install <version>   download and list a specific version

Environment variables:

        $VERSIONS          directory G.O.V. stores downloaded versions: ~/.gov/versions
        $CURRENT           file containing current version string value: ~/.gov/current
        $BIN               path to GOBIN directory that is only used in init command: ~/.gov/bin
        $GO                path to common and the currently linked version of Go: ~/.gov/go
